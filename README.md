# CS163 Group 11: Pok√©mon Data Analysis and Web Application

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data analysis pipeline and web application focused on Pok√©mon data. The project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, culminating in a user-friendly web interface that presents insights derived from the dataset.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevincui1034/cs163_group11.git
   cd cs163_group11
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source ./.venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```


## Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Sourced Pok√©mon data from Pok√©mon datasets and Smogon website.
   - Obtained general Pok√©mon data such as generation, stats, type etc.
   - Obtained competetive Pok√©mon data such as usage rate, checks and counters, and moveset.
   - Stored data as CSV and JSON

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and normalize data to ensure consistency.
   - Handle missing values and correct data types.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Perform statistical analyses to uncover patterns and insights.
   - Generate visualizations to represent data distributions and relationships.

4. **Web Application Development:**
   - Utilizes Flask framework for web development.
   - Dash for styling and graphs.
   - Deploy the application using Google App Engine.
